ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Python and scikit-learn to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on biological features from a public dataset.
It covers the complete machine learning pipeline:

    Loading biological data (Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn)

    Preprocessing (feature scaling)

    Training a Random Forest Classifier

    Evaluating the model's performance

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset included in sklearn.datasets.
It contains 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
The target variable indicates whether the tumor is:

    0 â†’ Malignant (cancerous)

    1 â†’ Benign (non-cancerous)
